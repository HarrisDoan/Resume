## Experience & Projects

### C++ Coding Projects | CS31 Projects <span class="spacer"></span>Jan 2023 - Mar 2022

*Projects from CS31 Winter 2023 with Prof. Bruce Huang* <span class="spacer"></span> C++

- Project 2 - Created a tax calculation program that users could input the name of their state of residence, the month, day, and year of purchase, and purchase amount to calculate the anticipated total. Also took into account each individual state's tax exemption days. Room for expansion allowing for changing of local tax rates and state tax rates.
- Project 3 - Created a program that took a quality control input string that would denote quality assurance test quantities, pass quantities, and defect quantities. Automatically detects incorrect quality assurance strings and returns an invalid computation. Works for an infinite amount of strings.

### TinyGL 3-D Interactive Game | Wii Archery for Dummies <span class="spacer"></span>Oct 2022 - Dec 2022

*Built an interactive 3D remake of Wii Archery using TinyGL*<span class="spacer"></span>Javascript | CSS | HTML | OpenGL / TinyGL | Github Desktop

- Recreate Wii Resorts Archery in TinyGL with user interactivity, scoreboard, increasing difficulty with moving targets, and immersive enviornment.
- Technical Features included implemented textures on the grass and trees to enhance environment, physics for projectile motion and inelastic collision, collision detection between arrow and target, moving target, increasing draw strength, and enviornmental lighting.
- Used OpenGL's subset TinyGL to create a powerful web application using their proprietary library of objects, texture implementation, and lighting.
- Used real world linear algebra and vector calculus to determine lighting angle, camera angle, camera position, object position, and player position.
- Collaborated in a three man team where I maintained a leadership role in producing quality code.

### 3D Computer Graphics Projects | CS174A Projects <span class="spacer"></span>Sep 2022 - Dec 2022

*Interactive 3D Projects from CS174A with Prof. Asish law* <span class="spacer"></span> JavaScript | CSS | HTML | OpenGL/TinyGL 

- Project 2 - swaying 3D cubes with aligned vertices and unique alternating colors
- Project 3 - 3D interactive solar system with unique planetary shapes, centralized sun as a light source, orbiting moons, planetary orbit, and interactive sun that oscillates in size. This oscillation changes the lighting of the enviroment and the color of the star itself. Each planet has unique shading using Phong shaders Gouraud shaders.
- Project 4 - Create a 3D texturized cube with moving textures that also rotated upon interaction.

### 3D Three.js Resume | Personal Resume Website <span class="spacer"></span> 2020-2021

*Single page e-commerce website* <span class="spacer"></span> JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Three.js

- Used the skills I learned building my 3D interactive game to build a 3D resume using a more modern library such as three.js
- Included all the relevant information in the HTML file and added 3D rotating objects and scrolling animation in the JavaScript.
- Stylized the objects with a 3D tourus and cube that simulates the subatomic orbits of atoms and atomic nucleus.
- Texturized the cube with a self portrait that wraps around all faces of the cube itself.
